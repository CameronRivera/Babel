# Babel

## Short description

This project started as a basic game where you would be presented with a sentence in another language, and you will have to identify it by selecting one of the presented our options, only one of which is correct. The presented sentence is a static one written in English and translated by a web API, a separate web API is then used to identify which language the translated text is written in. 

The simple game described above is wrapped up in another game in which you play the mythological figure Enma, and can damn souls to Hell, or help them move on to Heaven. It was my first project that made use of SceneKit and SpriteKit. There are a lot of untouched elements in each framework that I would like to explore. As an added challenge to myself, I wrote the whole program without making use of a storyboard. 

## Code Snippet of the most challenging part of the project 

```swift
func challengeFunction() {
 // Some code
